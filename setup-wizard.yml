      Your Beacon chain node must have access to a syncronized xdai mainnet node. 
      If you have not already, make sure to install and sync an xdai node of your choice.
      Then, input the URL of the node that you wish to use or a remote one:
      For example: https://rpc.xdaichain.com/

    title: Checkpoint for fast sync
    description: >-
      To get Prysm up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Prysm from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Check [Prysm docs](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/parameters/)
      Get your checkpoint sync from [infura](https://infura.io/) (i.e https://XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX@eth2-beacon-prater.infura.io)
