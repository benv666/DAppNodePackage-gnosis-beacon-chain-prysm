      Your Beacon chain node must have access to a syncronized xdai mainnet node. 
      If you have not already, make sure to install and sync an xdai node of your choice ([install nethermind gnosis](http://my.dappnode/#/installer/nethermind-xdai.dnp.dappnode.eth)) and use its RPC url
      Or use the official one: https://rpc.xdaichain.com/

    description: >-
      To get Prysm up and running in only a few minutes, you can start Prysm from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially **faster** and consumes **less resources** than syncing from genesis, while still providing all the same features. Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync.
      Get your checkpoint sync from a running gnosis beacon chain node or use the official one **https://rpc-gbc.gnosischain.com/**
